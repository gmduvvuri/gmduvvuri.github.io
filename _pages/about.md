I am interested in characterising exoplanetary systems and my current research
is primarily reconstructing the unobserved extreme ultraviolet emission of
cool dwarfs using observed X-ray and far ultraviolet emission. I generate
empirically informed low-resolution extreme ultraviolet spectra to use an
inputs for exoplanet atmosphere models and to study the relationships between
exoplanetary properties and their high-energy irradiation. I also work on
stellar activity more generally, and in the past I have worked on N-body
simulations of the tidal disruption of planetary material orbiting WD 1145+017.
