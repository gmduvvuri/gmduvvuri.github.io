Redoing DEMs for the LIEUVS I paper because I caught a typo in the resampling of X-ray contribution functions. Now that I have a better understanding of why some targets have had poorer than typical performance in the X-ray I am no longer settling for the systematic uncertainty parameter being close to unity. This has meant more reruns per star that I am redoing and more time working on the old desktop. Flare project is on hold until I get these out of the way, but I am going to start flare-excision for the LIEUVS stars that need it. Booked travel and lodging for Winter AAS now that the schedule is out and shows that there are sessions I should attend on the last day. Need to draft job ad for undergrads in time to go out during the first week of the next semester.
